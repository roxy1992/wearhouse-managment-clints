            Who are we?
            The question may arise in the minds of many who are we? We are now sitting down to write the answers to all those questions to remove all the doubts in their minds. We are not actually a shopkeeper or an agency, we are actually a group of people who collect the details of all the mobile phones and publish the posts on this site. Important thing is, we have not sold any mobiles so far, but we are aware of the prices of all the mobiles. We benefit people with mobile reviews and specifications.
